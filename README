# Math311_Linear_Algebra_Projects

This is a repository of projects for the Mathh 311 linear algebra course at Winona State University. It uses Google Colab and coding in Python to explore linear algebra concepts. 

# Projects:

1. Solve Systems using colab and Python

2. Using Google Co-Laboratory to introduce the idea of solving systems of equations with code:
